# Event Handling and Overlap Detection

## Event Positioning
- Events should be positioned at their precise time points using `getEventPosition(event.date)`
- Use `transform: translateX()` for consistent positioning with timeline ticks
- Blue marker lines should align perfectly with timeline ticks (1px width for precision)

## Overlap Detection
- Implement automatic overlap detection for events that occur at similar time points
- Use horizontal overlap detection based on event width (approximately 200px)
- Stack overlapping events vertically with consistent spacing (25px between events)
- Calculate Y positions recursively to handle multiple overlapping events

## Event Styling
- Use consistent event card styling with Tailwind classes
- Blue marker lines should extend from timeline to event cards
- Maintain proper z-index layering for overlapping events
- Use French locale formatting for all year displays

## Performance Considerations
- Filter visible events based on viewport boundaries
- Use efficient overlap detection algorithms
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders with proper reactive statements
